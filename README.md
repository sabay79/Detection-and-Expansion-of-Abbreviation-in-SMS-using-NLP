# Detection-and-Expansion-of-Abbreviation-in-SMS-using-NLP

The purpose of our project is to detect abbreviation in a sentence using Natural Language processing. Texting has become an integral part of our communications. Yet, we tend to type differently for personal and professional conversations. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word and we know that abbreviation are widely used in a short text messages. We formed a dictionary by collecting abbreviation/slangs via internet sources. Along with we have designed our own corpus from WhatsApp chats. The study looks at these abbreviations by analyzing those messages. Our model splits the corpus into tokens and look for the abbreviation over each token. It then lists all the abbreviation present in the corpus with their actual meanings. After performing the analysis, our model replaces all the abbreviations with their corresponding meaning. And the gives a statement with expended meaning. At the end/Lastly, we tested our model on the designed corpus and the result shows that it performed abbreviation detection task quite accurately.
